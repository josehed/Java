As mentioned in the readme in the above directory, the purpose of this assignment was to create a game engine which will accept two files which defines the game world and then build the world from them. The play was unable to use six key tree commands to explore the world around. “inventory” brought up a list of all of the artefacts currently being carried by the player, “get” followed by an item in the current location allowed the player to pick up said item, “drop” followed by an item name would drop an item if it was within the players inventory, “goto” was the command which allowed players to move between locations and “look” would return the description of the player's current location.

Depending on what was around the player, they were also able to interact with the world around them by using train the words. Say the player is in a forest with a large oak tree in front of them and also has an axe and their inventory, typing “Chop down tree” will allow the player to cut down the tree and would produce a log. There can be many trigger words and many actions and is only limited by the imagination of the creator of actions and entity game files which are provided to the engine.
