For the DB/databases assignment we were asked to design and create a program which mimicked a basic version of MariaDB. The program we created had to be able to create, insert, alter, update and delete tables within a file structure of our choosing as well as being able to handle complex search queries and joins.

The STAG assignment asked us to create a â€œgeneral-purpose socket-server game-engine for text adventure games. The program would accept two files, one of which contained the possible actions of the player and their consequences within a dot file and the other contains the entities within the game world contained within a json file. Our game engine had to take in these files, generate a world from them and then allow the player to play the game and explore the world which was created.
