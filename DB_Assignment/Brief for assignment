As a quick run down the assignment was to create an simplified version of MySQL which would persistantly store data, create tables/databases, insert and edit data.

Here are the commands which we had to program.

USE: changes the database against which the following queries will be run
CREATE: constructs a new database or table (depending on the provided parameters)
INSERT: adds a new entity to an existing table
SELECT: searches for entities that match the given condition
UPDATE: changes the data contained within a table
ALTER: changes the structure (rows) of an existing table
DELETE: removes entities that match the given condition from an existing table
DROP: removes a specified table from a database, or removes the entire database
AND / OR: allows conditions to be combined (makes use of parentheses to define ordering)
LIKE: used for comparing partial substrings in conditions
JOIN: performs an inner join on two tables (returning all permutations of all matching entities)
